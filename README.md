# Code Quiz

## How it works:

I have a created a multiple choice quiz, which consists of 4 questions around HTML, CSS and Javascript.
When you first go to the webpage, You will see a brief explanation explaining that this is a timed quiz. You will also see a start button. Once you press start, you will be presented with the first question.

When you click next, you will be presented with the next question and so on, until you complete the quiz. You will then be given your final score and asked to enter your initials in order to submit your final score.

You are given 60 seconds to complete the quiz, however each wrong answer you enter will result in 10 seconds being taken off your time.
